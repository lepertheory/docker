# README

## Read files that match `[0-9A-Z-_]+\.md`.
Try not to name any files that shouldn't be required reading for anyone in or under that directory
something matching that pattern. Try really hard to not let the presence of one of those files
change the built artifacts (unless it would make something work contrary to expectations).

## Read README.md
You _must_ read and understand the contents of every `README.md` to work in that directory. By
extension, try not to make them too long.

## Leave trails!
TODO: Explain this. See `src/contexts/lfs-bootstrap/Dockerfile` for the REF: stuff.
